# Web_scraping

This solution catch all the img and background-images of div components and presents them in a carouselm besides that catch all words inside a html element and presents them into a top 10 grid and a top 10 chart. 

The application uses Bootstrap and chart.js in the frontend and Asp.Net webforms in the backend.

The Default.aspx page is the main and only page and does all the work.

an example to test the page is the website https://pastiera.com.br/

use other sites to test but be awared to the limitations, image tags diferents of the listed above won't work
